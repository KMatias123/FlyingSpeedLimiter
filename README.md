# FlyingSpeedLimiter

This plugin limits the flying speed of players that are in adventure or survival mode.
The h and y speeds are limited separately.

Set the value moved-too-quickly-multiplier in spigot.yml to a high number, like 1000 for it not to interfere
with the plugin. This plugin is meant to replace that feature.
